Libreg is nearly finished though minor changes and bug fixes continue since V5. Most of the change in V6 were in cctest and concerned support for the new GLOBAL CYCLE_SELECTOR parameter. This is step towards the new libcc and the multi-threaded ccrt, which will be based on cctest.

Libcc/ccrt will be started in early 2015, however, the priority will be to deply libreg into operation, which will probably take the three months.
